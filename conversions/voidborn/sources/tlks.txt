# TLKS - Abyss of Shadows
# NPCs: Shadow of self, hidden message
# Theme: Darkness, self-confrontation, concealed truth

# Record 0 - Shadow of Self
I am what you hide
from yourself. The
fear you swallow.
The doubt you bury.
Face me.
---
# Record 1 - Shadow of Self
The Voidborn does
not create shadows.
It reveals them.
Everything you see
here was always
in you.
---
# Record 2 - Hidden Message
Behind the deepest
shadow lies the
Shard of Night. It
drinks light. It
drinks courage.
---
# Record 3 - Fading Phantom
I was a hero once.
Then I met my
shadow here. Now
I am neither hero
nor shadow. Just
remnant.
---
# Record 4 - Scratched Stone
THE LAST SHARD
COMPLETES THE SEAL.
BRING ALL FOUR TO
THE SANCTUM. END
THIS.
