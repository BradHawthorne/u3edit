# TLKF - Grimwall (Grey equivalent)
# NPCs: Commander Hask, Watchman, Healer, soldiers
# Theme: Fortification, paranoia, the spreading corruption

# Record 0 - Commander Hask
Grimwall holds. We
are the shield
between the havens
and what comes from
the north.
---
# Record 1 - Commander Hask (paranoia)
Trust no one who
comes from beyond
the wall after
dark. The Thralls
wear familiar faces.
---
# Record 2 - Commander Hask (intel)
The corruption
spreads from the
spires. We burn
what we can but it
grows back faster.
---
# Record 3 - Watchman
I stand the night
watch. Last week I
saw something in
the ash. Tall.
Thin. Too many
limbs.
---
# Record 4 - Watchman (warning)
The null fields
flicker at dawn.
That is when they
test our walls.
Stay alert.
---
# Record 5 - Healer
I treat wounds the
old way now. Magic
draws the Voidborn's
attention. Needles
and herbs suffice.
---
# Record 6 - Healer (lore)
The corruption
enters through open
wounds. If the
ichor touches blood
you have minutes.
---
# Record 7 - Soldier
We lost the eastern
tower last month.
Something nests
there now. Command
says leave it.
---
# Record 8 - Soldier (rumor)
The Last Wall to
the south still
stands. If Grimwall
falls, that is our
only retreat.
---
# Record 9 - Refugee
I came from
Riftwatch. The rift
there pulses like
a heartbeat now.
The town won't
last.
