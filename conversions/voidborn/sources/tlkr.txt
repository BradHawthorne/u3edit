# TLKR - Abyss of Echoes
# NPCs: Whispering voice, reflected warning
# Theme: Repetition, distortion, identity erosion

# Record 0 - Whispering Voice
Can you hear me?
I am the echo of
the last one who
came here. They
did not leave.
---
# Record 1 - Whispering Voice
The walls repeat
everything. Not
just sound. They
repeat people.
Do not touch them.
---
# Record 2 - Reflected Warning
I look like you
because I am what
the Abyss made of
the last visitor.
Do not become me.
---
# Record 3 - Reflected Warning
The Shard of Voice
screams endlessly.
Follow the scream.
It will lead you
to the center.
---
# Record 4 - Fading Script
EVERY ECHO IS A
COPY. EVERY COPY
LOSES SOMETHING.
THE VOID IS THE
LAST ECHO.
