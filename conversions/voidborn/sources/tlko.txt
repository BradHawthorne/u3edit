# TLKO - Abyss of Serpents
# NPCs: Poisoned adventurer, warning echo
# Theme: Venom, treachery, coiled darkness

# Record 0 - Poisoned Adventurer
The venom is in
the air here. My
antidotes ran out
on the third level.
Cover your mouth.

# Record 1 - Poisoned Adventurer
The serpents here
are not animals.
They think. They
plan. They herd
you toward the pit.
---
# Record 2 - Warning Echo
Shed your skin or
be consumed. The
serpent sheds. The
void sheds worlds.
You cling and die.

# Record 3 - Wounded Scout
The Shard of Scale
lies in the nest
at the bottom. The
mother guards it.
She is enormous.

# Record 4 - Scratched Wall
TRUST NOTHING THAT
SLITHERS. THE
FLOOR IS NOT
ALWAYS THE FLOOR.
