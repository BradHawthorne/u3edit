# TLKK - The Last Wall
# NPCs: Garrison Commander, Veteran, Spy, Soldiers
# Theme: Final warnings, combat intel, desperate defense

# Record 0 - Garrison Commander
This is the last
barrier between
the settled lands
and the Breach
itself. Hold fast.
---
# Record 1 - Garrison Commander (orders)
We cannot hold
forever. Find the
Shards. Seal the
Breach. That is
our only hope.
---
# Record 2 - Garrison Commander (warning)
Beyond this wall
reality thins. You
will see things
that cannot exist.
Trust your blade
not your eyes.
---
# Record 3 - Veteran
I have fought the
void for ten years.
Every battle costs
more than the last.
We are losing.
---
# Record 4 - Veteran (combat)
The boss creatures
negate magic. Do
not rely on spells
alone. Carry steel
and use it.
---
# Record 5 - Veteran (confession)
I dream of the
void now. It shows
me a world without
pain. I know it
lies. I think.
---
# Record 6 - Spy
I crossed beyond
the wall and came
back. Barely. The
Cult has built a
fortress there.
---
# Record 7 - Spy (intel)
The Void Cult
channels energy
from the rifts to
feed the Voidborn.
Cut the channels
cut the power.
---
# Record 8 - Soldier
My first posting
and they send me
here. The screaming
starts at dusk and
ends at dawn.
---
# Record 9 - Lookout
I count the eyes
in the darkness
each night. Last
night I stopped
counting at forty.
