# NPCs: Mayor Corren, herbalist, trader, refugees
# Theme: Survival tips, local danger, supply trade

# Record 0 - Mayor Corren
Welcome to Ashfall.
We survive, barely.
The ash rains every
third day now.
---
# Record 1 - Mayor Corren (warning)
The spires to the
north hum louder
each week. When
they go silent,
run.
---
# Record 2 - Herbalist
The fungal growths
are toxic but some
have uses. I brew
what salves I can
from them.
---
# Record 3 - Herbalist (tip)
If the ichor burns
you, pack ash on
the wound. It draws
the poison out.
---
# Record 4 - Trader
Supplies are scarce.
I trade what the
caravans bring. Do
not ask where they
find it.
---
# Record 5 - Trader (rumor)
A smith in
Duskhollow forges
blades that hold
an edge against
the Thralls.
---
# Record 6 - Refugee
We fled Grimwall
when the null field
collapsed. Three
days through ash
and Thralls.
---
# Record 7 - Refugee (lore)
My grandmother said
the moongates once
carried travelers
safely. Now they
vomit corruption.
---
# Record 8 - Child
Mama says don't
look at the sky
when it turns
purple. I looked
once. I saw teeth.
