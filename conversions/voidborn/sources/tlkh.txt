# TLKH - Thornhaven
# NPCs: Forager Wyn, Mycologist, Guide, Locals
# Theme: Mushrooms, spore lore, forest paths

# Record 0 - Forager Wyn
The forest feeds us
and poisons us in
equal measure. You
learn which is
which or you die.
---
# Record 1 - Forager Wyn (mushrooms)
The blue caps heal.
The red caps kill.
The black caps...
those are not
mushrooms at all.
---
# Record 2 - Forager Wyn (warning)
Never eat anything
that pulses. If it
has a heartbeat it
is not food. It is
a lure.
---
# Record 3 - Mycologist
The spores carry
information. The
fungal network is
alive and it
remembers.
---
# Record 4 - Mycologist (lore)
Before the Breach
these were normal
woods. The void
energy mutated
everything.
---
# Record 5 - Mycologist (discovery)
I have found spore
patterns that match
the Sigil glyphs.
The forest knows
the old seals.
---
# Record 6 - Guide
Stay on the marked
paths. The mycelium
shifts overnight
and opens sinkholes
without warning.
---
# Record 7 - Guide (route)
The northern path
leads to the Spire
ruins. The southern
fork reaches the
Ash Plains border.
---
# Record 8 - Local Elder
Thornhaven has
stood since before
the Breach. The
thorns protect us.
They always have.
---
# Record 9 - Child Forager
I found a glowing
stone in the deep
woods. Mama says
it is a Shard
fragment. Is it?
