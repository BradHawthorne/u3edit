# Record 0 - Hallucinating Wanderer
Are you real? I
cannot tell. The
walls breathe and
the floor speaks
my name.

# Record 1 - Hallucinating Wanderer
It shows you what
you want to see.
Then it takes that
away. Then it takes
everything else.

# Record 2 - Lost Soul
I have been here
for... days? Years?
Time folds in on
itself. Do not
trust the clocks.
---
# Record 3 - Lost Soul (warning)
The Shard of Mind
is here somewhere.
It whispers. If
you hear singing
walk the other way.

# Record 4 - Voice in the Dark
You are already
lost. You simply
have not realized
it yet. Welcome
home.
