# TLKQ - Abyss of Time
# NPCs: Temporal echo, frozen adventurer
# Theme: Time distortion, loops, entropy

# Record 0 - Temporal Echo
You have been here
before. You will
be here again. The
loop tightens with
each passage.
---
# Record 1 - Temporal Echo
I am you. Or I was
you. Or I will be.
The tenses break
down this deep.
It does not matter.
---
# Record 2 - Frozen Adventurer
I reached for the
Shard and time
stopped. I have
watched centuries
pass in stillness.
---
# Record 3 - Frozen Adventurer
The Shard of Hours
freezes what it
touches. Do not
grasp it with bare
hands. Wrap it.
---
# Record 4 - Carved Warning
TIME IS THE FIRST
THING THE VOID
CONSUMES. IF YOU
FORGET THE SUN
YOU ARE ALREADY
LOST.
