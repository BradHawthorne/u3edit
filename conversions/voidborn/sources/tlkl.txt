# TLKL - Deep Reef
# NPCs: Coral Sage, Shell Trader, Diver, Reef folk
# Theme: Ancient lore, underwater trade, exploration

# Record 0 - Coral Sage
The reef predates
the Breach by eons.
It remembers a
time before even
the old kingdoms.
---
# Record 1 - Coral Sage (lore)
The coral sings at
night. Not music.
Warnings. It knows
the void touches
the deep waters.
---
# Record 2 - Coral Sage (knowledge)
A Shard rests in
the deepest trench.
The reef grew
around it as if
protecting it.
---
# Record 3 - Shell Trader
Shells from the
deep glow faintly.
They ward against
minor void energy.
Not cheap though.
---
# Record 4 - Shell Trader (wares)
I have diving bells
and pressure salves.
The deep trenches
crush the careless.
Come prepared.
---
# Record 5 - Diver
I have seen things
in the deep that
have no name. They
watch from crevices
with too many eyes.
---
# Record 6 - Diver (route)
The trench entrance
is south of the
main reef shelf.
Follow the biolum
coral. It marks
the safe path.
---
# Record 7 - Diver (warning)
The creatures that
divide in two when
struck infest the
lower depths. Fire
does not work
underwater.
---
# Record 8 - Reef Elder
Our ancestors built
on the reef because
the void cannot
easily reach
through salt water.
---
# Record 9 - Fisher
The fish have
changed. Extra
fins. Wrong colors.
I still eat them.
What choice is
there?
