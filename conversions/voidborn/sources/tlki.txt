# TLKI - Ironhold East
# NPCs: Mine Boss, Gem Dealer, Engineer, Miners
# Theme: Mining gems, underground trade, tunnels

# Record 0 - Mine Boss
The eastern shafts
still produce but
we lose miners to
cave-ins weekly.
The stone is wrong.
---
# Record 1 - Mine Boss (gems)
Void crystals fetch
a high price. They
resonate near rift
energy. Dangerous
to mine though.
---
# Record 2 - Mine Boss (warning)
Shaft seven is
sealed. Something
lives down there
now. We hear it
scratching.
---
# Record 3 - Gem Dealer
I buy raw and sell
cut. Void crystals
are unstable but
they amplify any
enchantment.
---
# Record 4 - Gem Dealer (trade)
Bring me uncut
stones from the
deep shafts and I
will pay double
what the surface
traders offer.
---
# Record 5 - Engineer
The tunnels connect
to something older.
Pre-Breach ruins
carved by hands
that were not human.
---
# Record 6 - Engineer (discovery)
I found markings
in the deep tunnels
that match the
Sigil patterns.
Someone sealed
something here.
---
# Record 7 - Miner
The deeper we dig
the warmer it gets.
Not natural warmth.
It feels like
being watched.
---
# Record 8 - Miner (rumor)
Old Gareth says he
found a passage to
an Abyss entrance
in the lowest
shaft. He drinks
though.
---
# Record 9 - Ore Sorter
I sort the rubble.
Sometimes I find
teeth in the ore.
Not animal teeth.
Something else.
