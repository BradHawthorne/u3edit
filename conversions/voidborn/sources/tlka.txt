# TLKA - Prophet's Bastion (Lord British Castle)
# NPCs: The Echo, Guard Captain, Archivist, servants
# Theme: Quest exposition, Sigil lore, warnings about the void

# Record 0 - The Echo (main quest giver)
I am the Echo of
the Prophet. He saw
the Breach before
it tore the sky.
---
# Record 1 - The Echo (Sigil quest)
Four Sigils hold the
seal. Find them in
corrupted shrines.
Without them, all
is lost.
---
# Record 2 - The Echo (Shard quest)
The Sigils reveal
the Shards. Descend
the Abysses. Bring
what you find to
the Sanctum.
---
# Record 3 - Guard Captain
The null field
weakens. Each night
something tests
our walls. Arm
yourselves well.
---
# Record 4 - Guard Captain (warning)
Do not travel the
ash plains at night.
The Thralls hunt by
sound alone.
---
# Record 5 - Archivist
Before the Breach,
this was a place of
learning. Now I
guard what little
knowledge survives.
---
# Record 6 - Archivist (lore)
The Voidborn is not
a creature. It is a
presence. It does
not hate us. It
does not see us.
---
# Record 7 - Servant
The Prophet speaks
through echoes now.
His body is sealed
beyond the null
field. We pray.
---
# Record 8 - Servant (rumor)
A trader from
Ashfall says the
fungal forests
are spreading
faster now.
---
# Record 9 - Guard (gate)
You are free to
leave, but know
this: the Bastion
may not stand when
you return.
