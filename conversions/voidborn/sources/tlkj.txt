# Record 0 - Master Smith
I forge what kills
void creatures.
Normal steel bends
against their hide.
You need alloys.
---
# Record 1 - Master Smith (weapons)
Void crystal folded
into the blade edge
lets it bite where
steel alone would
slide off.
---
# Record 2 - Master Smith (request)
Bring me ore from
the deep shafts
and I will forge
something worthy
of the Abysses.
---
# Record 3 - Armorer
Plate mail saves
lives but slows
you down. Against
Thralls, speed
matters more.
---
# Record 4 - Armorer (advice)
Chain with crystal
threading resists
void corruption.
Expensive but you
only die once.
---
# Record 5 - Armorer (lore)
The old armor from
before the Breach
had runes we cannot
read. It held
better than ours.
---
# Record 6 - Courier
News from the west:
Ashfall still holds
but the rift count
doubled. Riftwatch
sends patrols now.
---
# Record 7 - Courier (news)
The Last Wall
garrison reports
movement beyond
their perimeter.
Something large.
---
# Record 8 - Courier (rumor)
A messenger from
the Prophet says
a fifth Sigil may
exist. One that
was never sealed.
---
# Record 9 - Apprentice Smith
The master will
not say it but
we are running
low on ore. The
mines falter.
