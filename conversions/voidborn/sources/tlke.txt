# TLKE - Duskhollow (Fawn equivalent)
# NPCs: Elder Syl, Scout Brynn, Smith, townsfolk
# Theme: Hints about the Flame Sigil location

# Record 0 - Elder Syl
Duskhollow endures
because we remember
the old ways. Fire
still holds power
here.
---
# Record 1 - Elder Syl (Sigil hint)
The Shrine of
Immolation lies
where Brand once
stood. Only flame
can purify the
corruption there.
---
# Record 2 - Elder Syl (warning)
Pyric Horrors guard
the shrine. They
burn with stolen
fire. Bring wards
or perish.
---
# Record 3 - Scout Brynn
I mapped a path
through the ash
plains to the
shrine. Avoid the
ichor pools.
---
# Record 4 - Scout Brynn (tactical)
The Horrors are
blind but sense
heat. Approach from
downwind if you
can.
---
# Record 5 - Smith
I forge what I can.
The old steel rusts
fast now. Only
void-touched metal
holds its edge.
---
# Record 6 - Smith (trade)
Bring me crystal
from the spires and
I will forge you
something worth
carrying.
---
# Record 7 - Townsfolk
They say the Flame
Sigil burns so
bright that even
the Voidborn flinch
from it.
---
# Record 8 - Townsfolk (rumor)
A scout went to
the shrine alone.
Came back changed.
Won't speak. Just
stares at fire.
