# TLKB - Eyeless Spire (Castle of Death / Void Cult HQ)
# NPCs: Cult members, prisoners, a turncoat
# Theme: Void Cult motives, threats, cryptic prophecy

# Record 0 - Cult Acolyte
The Voidborn offers
what your Prophet
never could:
certainty. Join us
or be unmade.
---
# Record 1 - Cult Priest
You cling to a
dying world. We
have seen what
comes after. It is
beautiful.
---
# Record 2 - Cult Priest (threat)
The Sigils you seek
are poison. Each
one you claim draws
the Voidborn's gaze
upon you.
---
# Record 3 - The Eyeless Seer
I tore out my eyes
so I could truly
see. The void is
not empty. It
watches. It waits.
---
# Record 4 - Prisoner
Please... they took
my eyes but I can
still hear it. The
humming. It never
stops.
---
# Record 5 - Prisoner (desperate)
The cult feeds
prisoners to the
Abyss. Do not let
them take you
below.
---
# Record 6 - Turncoat
I was one of them.
The rituals change
you. I fled before
it was too late.
Barely.
---
# Record 7 - Turncoat (hint)
The Seer guards a
Shard. But she
fears the Sigil of
Flame above all.
Fire still burns.
---
# Record 8 - Cult Guard
Kneel before the
Voidborn or be
consumed. There is
no third path.
