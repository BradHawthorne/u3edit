# TLKM - Abyss of Flame
# NPCs: Trapped explorer, dying adventurer
# Theme: Magma warnings, heat madness, desperation

# Record 0 - Trapped Explorer
Turn back. The
magma rises when
it senses you.
This place is
alive and hungry.
---
# Record 1 - Trapped Explorer (plea)
I cannot feel my
legs. The heat
fused my armor to
my skin. Leave me.
Find the Shard.
---
# Record 2 - Dying Adventurer
The Shard of Flame
burns in the lowest
chamber. I touched
it. It showed me
the Breach opening.
---
# Record 3 - Dying Adventurer (vision)
In the vision I
saw four seals
breaking. The
Voidborn poured
through like water.
---
# Record 4 - Echo in Stone
Fire cannot kill
what was never
alive. The void
laughs at your
flames.
