# NPCs: Chained prisoner, spectral guard
# Theme: Bondage, forgotten prisoners, inescapable duty

# Record 0 - Chained Prisoner
They chained me
here as a warning.
I stole from the
Cult. Now I feed
what lives below.

# Record 1 - Chained Prisoner (info)
The guard is dead
but does not know
it. His duty binds
him past death.
Pity him.

# Record 2 - Spectral Guard
None shall pass.
I guard this gate
as I have for...
how long has it
been? I forget.
---
# Record 3 - Spectral Guard (lament)
The Shard of Bonds
holds me here. Take
it if you can. Free
me from this
endless watch.
---
# Record 4 - Inscription
The chains that
bind the willing
are the strongest.
The void offers
chains gladly.
