# TLKG - Riftwatch
# NPCs: Rift Scholar, Merchant, Refugee, Watcher
# Theme: Rift behavior, trade, danger warnings

# Record 0 - Rift Scholar
The rifts pulse in
cycles. I have
mapped their rhythm
but cannot explain
what drives them.
---
# Record 1 - Rift Scholar (theory)
Each Sigil sealed
corresponds to a
weakening in the
Breach. Four Sigils
four wounds.
---
# Record 2 - Rift Scholar (warning)
When a rift turns
from violet to
black it is about
to discharge. Run.
Do not look back.
---
# Record 3 - Merchant
Trade is thin but
I stock what the
scavengers bring.
Potions and blades
mostly.
---
# Record 4 - Merchant (rumor)
A caravan from the
Deep Reef brought
coral that glows
near void energy.
Useful for finding
rifts.
---
# Record 5 - Refugee
We came from the
eastern bastions.
The Void Cult
overran them in
a single night.
---
# Record 6 - Refugee (plea)
If you venture
east beware the
Cult patrols. They
take prisoners for
their rituals.
---
# Record 7 - Watcher
I stand here every
night and count
the rifts. There
were twelve last
month. Now thirty.
---
# Record 8 - Watcher (observation)
The moongates
flicker when the
rifts open. They
are connected
somehow.
---
# Record 9 - Guard
Riftwatch holds
because we watch.
The moment we stop
looking is the
moment we fall.
