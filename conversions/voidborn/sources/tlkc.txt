# NPCs: Pit Master, Spectators, Challenger
# Theme: Combat hints, martial lore, proving ground

# Record 0 - Pit Master
Welcome to the Pit.
Here we train for
what lurks beyond
the walls. Step in
or step aside.
---
# Record 1 - Pit Master (advice)
The Thralls fear
fire but resist
cold. Strike fast
before they
swarm you.
---
# Record 2 - Pit Master (lore)
Before the Breach
this was a court
of honor. Now it
is survival
practice.
---
# Record 3 - Spectator
I saw a ranger
take down three
Spore Hulks alone.
She used the
terrain wisely.
---
# Record 4 - Spectator (tip)
Corners are death
traps in combat.
Keep your healer
behind the line
and flanks clear.
---
# Record 5 - Spectator (rumor)
They say the Abyss
of Flame holds a
Shard. But none
who enter have
returned yet.
---
# Record 6 - Challenger
You look soft. I
have survived six
Abysses. Care to
test your blade
against mine?
---
# Record 7 - Challenger (warning)
The deeper Abysses
have creatures that
negate all magic.
Steel is your only
friend down there.
---
# Record 8 - Arena Healer
I mend what I can.
The wounds from
void creatures
heal slower than
any I have seen.
---
# Record 9 - Veteran Fighter
The Sigil of War
is said to lie
beneath the Arena
foundations. Dig
deep, if you dare.
